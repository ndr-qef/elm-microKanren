import Dict

{-|
An index for a fresh logic variable.
-}
type alias Var = Int

{-|
A fresh logic variable, any elm value and pairs of the foregoing.
-}
type Term a
  = LVar Var
  | LVal a
  | Pair (Term a) (Term a)

{-|
An association between variables and terms.
-}
type alias Substitution a = Dict.Dict Var (Term a)

{-|
A pair of a substitution and a non-negative fresh variable counter.
-}
type alias State a
  = { s : Substitution a
    , c : Var }

{-|
A possibly-unbounded list of states.
-}
type Stream a
  = Empty
  | Immature (() -> Stream a)
  | Mature (State a) (Stream a)

{-|
Analogous to a predicate with a sequence of (enlarged) states.
-}
type alias Goal a
  = State a -> Stream a


{-|
Lifts the state into a stream whose only element is that state.
-}
unit : Goal a
unit sc = Mature sc Empty

{-|
The empty stream.
-}
mzero : Stream a
mzero = Empty


{-|
Searches for a variables value in the substitution.
-}
walk : Term a -> Substitution a -> Term a
walk t s =
  case t of
    LVar v -> case Dict.get v s of
      Just u  -> walk u s
      Nothing -> t
    _ -> t

{-|
Extends the substitution with a new binding.
-}
ext_s : Var -> Term a -> Substitution a -> Substitution a
ext_s k v s = Dict.insert k v s

{-|
Extends the substitution if exactly one term walks to a variable.

Leaves the substitution unaltered if both terms:
* walk to the same variable
* walk to the same value
* pairwise walk to the same substitution.

Fails otherwise.
-}

Merges two streams fairly.

{-|
Invokes the goal on each element in the stream merging the results fairly.

Succeeds when the terms unify.

Creates a fresh (new) logic variable.
-}
